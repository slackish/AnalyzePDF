"""
Analyzes PDF files by looking at their characteristics in order to add some 
intelligence into the determination of them being malicious or benign.

Usage:
$ AnalyzePDF.py [-h] [-m MOVE] [-y YARARULES] Path

Produces a high level overview of a PDF to quickly determine if further
analysis is needed based on it's characteristics

positional arguments:
  Path                  Path to directory/file(s) to be scanned

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MOVE, --move MOVE  Directory to move files triggering YARA hits to
  -y YARARULES, --yararules YARARULES
                        Path to YARA rules. Rules should contain a weighted
                        score in the metadata section. (i.e. weight = 3)

example: python AnalyzePDF.py -m tmp/badness -y foo/pdf.yara bar/getsome.pdf

# Version 0.2 
# Date: 10-11-2012
# Requirements:
#    - Python 2.x
#    - YARA (http://plusvic.github.io/yara/)
#    - pdfid (http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/)
#
# Optional:    
#    * This script will work without these but may miss some conditions to evaluate 
#     based on the missing data they would provide (i.e. - # of Pages) *
#
#    - pdfinfo (www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html)
#    - a "weight" field within the YARA's rule meta should be added to help in the 
#     final evaluation
#        i.e. - rule pdf_example {meta: weight = 3 strings: $s = "evil" 
#       condition: $s}
#
# To-Do:
#    - suppress pdfid's output log
#    - be able to print out which conditions it met in the rules
